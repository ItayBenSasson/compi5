# compi5


work process:
step 1: add support for TODO in Emit_handler.cpp file.

step 2: make sure all names are different (i changed a bit, but not all of them and not a ton).

step 3: make sure it now works perfectly in all tests as it should couse its a mixture of gross+block reference and our previous setup from hw3.

step 4: add changes that we can from syntax to symply patching it with shmerler's code/dana's code.

Step 5: if we finish it in time, expect some rockets from Tehran.
